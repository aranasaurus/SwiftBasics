## Interactive Swift playground containing basic Swift Syntax.

With added (Monty) Python.

Plenty more syntax and introduction can be found in [Apple's official Swift documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH3-ID0).

[This reference cheat sheet](https://github.com/iwasrobbed/Swift-CheatSheet) also contains tonnes of useful stuff.

### Requirements:
* Xcode 7 (beta) - download [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/)
* Swift 2

### To Use:

1. Git clone this repo
2. Open `SwiftSyntax.playground` in Xcode 7.
3. Play!
